# Covid-19-Mask-Dectection
Dectection algorithm that can track and identify and label faces with or without a mask. 
Algorithm uses a training data set of 690 images in total with and without masks, data is 
preprocessed ( grayscaled and resized) and then fed into a C.N.N (convolutional neural network) model
for training, after several runs with the training data for each epoch, the epoch model with the lowest 
validation loss and highest accuracy is selected for prediction model.
