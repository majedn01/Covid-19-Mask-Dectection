# Covid-19-Mask-Dectection
Dectection algorithm that can track and label faces with or without a mask. 
Data is preprocessed ( grayscaled and resized) and then processed through a C.N.N (convolutional neural network),
after several runs with the training sets for each epoch, the epoch model with the lowest 
validation loss and highest accuracy is selected as the final prediction model for classification.
